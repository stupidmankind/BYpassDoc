Project Window
===============

The Project panel enables you to view the contents of the current project, add folders, open the file location, manage dependencies, and adjust project settings.

Copy and paste files from File Explorer directly into the Project panel. The same can be done using drag and drop on one or multiple files, including .xml workflows. You can also use the Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V shortcuts or Copy and Paste options in the context menu to copy and duplicate files or folders inside the panel.
